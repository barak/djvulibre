.SH NAME
djvutoxml, djvuxmlparser \- DjVuLibre XML Tools.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "djvutoxml [" options "] " inputdjvufile " [" outputxmlfile "]"
.br
.BI "djvuxmlparser [ -o " djvufile " ] " inputxmlfile 


.SH DESCRIPTION
The DjVuLibre XML Tools provide for editing the
metadata, hyperlinks and hidden text 
associated with DjVu files.  Unlike 
.BR djvused (1)
the DjVuLibre XML Tools rely on the XML technology
and can take advantage of XML editors and verifiers.

.SH DJVUTOXML
Program
.B djvutoxml
creates a XML file
.I outputxmlfile
containing a reference to the original DjVu document
.I inputdjvufile
as well as tags describing the metadata,
hyperlinks, and hidden text associated with the DjVu file.

The following options are supported:
.TP
.BI "--page " "pagenum"
Select a page in a multi-page document.
Without this option, 
.B djvutoxml
outputs the XML 
corresponding to all pages of the document.
.TP 
.BI "--with-text"
Specifies the 
.B HIDDENTEXT 
element for each page should be included in the output.  
If specified without the
.B --with-anno
flag then the
.B --without-anno 
is implied.  If none of the  
.B --with-text, 
.B --without-text, 
.B --with-anno, 
or
.B --without-anno, 
flags are specified, then the  
.B --with-text 
and 
.B --with-anno 
flags are implied.
.TP
.BI "--without-text"
Specifies not to output the 
.B HIDDENTEXT 
element for each page.  If specified without the 
.B --without-anno 
flag then the 
.B --with-anno 
flag is implied.
.TP
.BI "--with-anno"
Specifies the area 
.B MAP 
element for each page should be included in the output.  
If specified without the
.B --with-text 
flag then the
.B --without-text 
flag is implied.
.TP
.BI "--without-anno"
Specifies the area 
.B MAP 
element for each page should not be included in the output.  
If specified without the
.B --without-text 
flag then the
.B --with-text 
flag is implied.


.SH DJVUXMLPARSER

Files produced by 
.B djvutoxml
can then be modified using 
either a text editor or a XML editor.
Program
.B djvuxmlparser
parses the XML file 
.I inputxmlfile
in order to modify the metadata of the corresponding DjVu file.
.TP
.BI "-o " "djvufile"
In principle the target DjVu file is the file 
referenced by the
.I OBJECT 
element of the XML file. 
This option provides the means to override the filename
specified in the 
.I OBJECT
element.

.SH DJVUXML DOCUMENT TYPE DEFINITION
The document type definition file (DTD)
.IP "" 2
.B @DATADIR@/djvu/pubtext/DjVuXML-s.dtd
.PP
defines the input and output of the DjVu XML tools.

The DjVuXML-s DTD is a simplification of the HTML DTD:
.IP "" 2
.B \%http://www.w3c.org/TR/1998/REC-html40-19980424/sgml/dtd.html
.PP
with a few new attributes added specific to DjVu.  Each of the 
specified pages of a DjVu document are represented as 
.B OBJECT 
elements within the 
.B BODY 
element of the XML file. 
Each 
.B OBJECT
element may contain multiple 
.B PARAM 
elements to specify attributes like page name,
resolution,
and gamma factor.
Each 
.B OBJECT
element may also contain one
.B HIDDENTTEXT
element to specify the hidden text (usually generated with an OCR engine) 
within the DjVu page.  In addition each 
.B OBJECT
element may reference a single area 
.B MAP
element which contains multiple
.B AREA
elements to represent all the hyperlink and highlight areas within 
the DjVu document.

.SS PARAM Elements
Legal 
.B PARAM 
elements of a DjVu 
.B OBJECT 
include but are not limited to
.B PAGE
for specifying the page-name,
.B GAMMA
for specifying the gamma correction factor (normally 2.2), and
.B DPI
for specifying the page resolution.

.SS HIDDENTEXT Elements
The 
.B HIDDENTEXT
elements consists of nested elements of 
.B PAGECOLUMNS,
.B REGION,
.B PARAGRAPH,
.B LINE,
and
.B WORD.
The most deeply nested element specified, should specify the bounding 
coordinates of the element in top-down orientation.  The body of the 
most deeply nested element should contain the text.  Most DjVu 
documents use either 
.B LINE 
or 
.B WORD 
as the lowest level element, but any element is legal as the lowest 
level element.  A white space is always added between 
.B WORD
elements and a line feed is always added between
.B LINE
elements.  Since languages such as Japanese do not use spaces between 
words, it is quite common for Asian OCR engines to use
.B WORD
as characters instead.

.SS MAP Elements
The body of the 
.B MAP
elements consist of 
.B AREA
elements.  In addition to the attributes listed in
.IP "" 2
.BR \%http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-html40-19980424/struct/objects.html#edef-AREA ,
.PP
the attributes
.BR bordertype ,
.BR bordercolor ,
.BR border ,
and 
.B highlight
have been added to specify border type, border color, border width, and 
highlight colors respectively.  Legal values for each of these attributes 
are listed in the DjVuXML-s DTD.
In addition, the shape
.B oval
has been added to the legal list of shapes.  An oval uses a rectangular 
bounding box.

.SH BUGS
Perhaps it would have been better to use CC2 style sheets 
with standard HTML elements instead of defining the 
.B HIDDENTEXT 
element.

.SH CREDITS
The DjVu XML tools and DTD were written
by Bill C. Riemers <docbill@sourceforge.net> 
and Fred Crary.
